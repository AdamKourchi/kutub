Islamic Books

This is a small static website built with React that showcases rendering data from an existing array of book objects into components using props. The design of the website is inspired by Islamic art and aesthetics.

The project demonstrates the usage of React components and props for building user interfaces. It provides an example of how to display book information such as title, author, and description dynamically.
